            <b>Proof of concept for the server API and data model.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid any complexity we start with a simple
            number guessing game, which however has all the elements
            of the actual game:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"Prepare" - </b> Player enters a number from 1-100.
            He submits the number to the server, where to same
            processing takes place as in the actual game (including
            validation), except the payload is not an array of ships
            but a plain number.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"Match" - </b> A list of ready players is displayed
            and two players can form a pair of oppenents.
            Almost the same as in the actual game from a data perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"Battle" -</b> Guessing instead of shooting
        </p>
        <p>
            As a proof of concept this is reduced to the minimum 
            and roughly patched together:
            no tests, no services, mimimal error handling
            and validation, lots of 'no-nos' like inline-styles, 
            breaks etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Player info:</b><br>
            - For a one-person test
            you have to use two different browsers and register two different
            users.<br>
            - Data cleanup is not very reliable yet. Use the "Purge" button to 
            start anew after you have already generated data (prep, match making, battle).
