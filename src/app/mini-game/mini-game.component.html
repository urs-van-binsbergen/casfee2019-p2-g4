            Proof of concept for the server API and data model. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is to remove all complexity and implement a simple 
            number guessing game, having all elements
            of the actual battleship game however.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"Prepare" - </b> Player enters a number from 1-100. 
            He submits the number to the server, where to same
            processing takes place as in the actual game (including
            validation), except the payload is not an array of ships
            but a plain number. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"Match" - </b> A list of ready players is displayed
            and two players can form a pair of oppenents. 
            Almost the same as in the actual game from a data perspective. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>"Battle" -</b> Guessing instead of shooting
        </p>
